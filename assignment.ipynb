    "**Q1.** This question provides some practice cleaning variables which have common problems.\n",
    "1. Numeric variable: For `./data/airbnb_hw.csv`, clean the `Price` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. How many missing values do you end up with? (Hint: What happens to the formatting when a price goes over 999 dollars, say from 675 to 1,112?)\n",
    "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing? \n",
    "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture `./data/justice_data.parquet`, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",
    "4. Missing values, not at random: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `ImposedSentenceAllChargeInContactEvent` variable as well as you can, and explain the choices you make. (Hint: Look at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable.)"
